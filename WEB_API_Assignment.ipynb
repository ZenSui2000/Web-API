        "A1. An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a standard way for applications to interact and exchange information, which makes it easier for developers to integrate different services and functionalities into their own applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "One real-life example of an API is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to embed Google Maps into their own applications and websites. By using the Google Maps API, developers can add maps and location-based features to their applications without having to build the maps themselves from scratch. This saves time and resources, and also ensures that the maps are accurate and up-to-date.\n",

        "Another example of an API is the Twitter API, which allows developers to access Twitter data and functionality, such as retrieving tweets,  and searching for tweets based on specific criteria. This API has been used to build a variety of Twitter-related applications, including social media monitoring tools, sentiment analysis tools, and Twitter bots\n",
